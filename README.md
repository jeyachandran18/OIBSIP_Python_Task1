# 🧮 BMI Calculator using Python Turtle

## 📌 Objective
To create a simple **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator** using Python’s `turtle` graphics module that demonstrates basic GUI input, calculations, and visual output for beginners learning turtle programming.

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Imported the `turtle` module and initialized the screen with a title.
2. Used `screen.numinput()` pop-up dialogs to collect user weight (kg) and height (m).
3. Calculated BMI using the formula:  
   **BMI = weight / (height ** 2)**
4. Applied `if-elif-else` conditions to classify BMI into:
   - Underweight
   - Normal
   - Overweight
   - Obese
5. Displayed the BMI value and health category using `pen.write()` at specific coordinates.
6. Added `exitonclick()` to close the turtle window on user interaction.

## ✅ Outcome
- Interactive turtle window displays entered height and weight.
- Calculates and shows BMI rounded to two decimal places.
- Displays the corresponding health category clearly.
- Beginner-friendly, visually clean, and educational.
- Suitable for academic projects, learning portfolios, and basic GUI demonstrations.
