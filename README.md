##Objective
Create a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using Python's turtle graphics module to demonstrate basic GUI input, calculations, and visual output for beginners learning turtle programming.​

#3Steps Performed
Imported turtle module and set up screen with title.

Used screen.numinput() popups to collect weight (kg) and height (m) from user.

Calculated BMI with formula: weight / (height ** 2).

Applied if-elif conditions to classify BMI into categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

Drew results using pen.write() at specific coordinates on the canvas.

Added exitonclick() to close on user click.​

##Tools Used
Python 3.x (standard library only).

turtle module for graphics, input dialogs, and text rendering (no external installs needed).

Runs in VS Code, IDLE, or any Python IDE.​

##Outcome
Interactive turtle window displays entered weight/height, computed BMI (to 2 decimals), and health category clearly formatted. Easy to run, educational for turtle basics, and produces professional-looking graphical results—ideal for portfolios or class projects like your previous BMI tracker
